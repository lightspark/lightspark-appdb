To install locally for testing/hacking:
- Symlink from /var/www to the appdb directory
- Copy include/config.php.sample to include/config.php
- Edit include/config.php as you see fit, the default name of the database 
  used in the table creation step below is "apidb", you'll have to modify 
  these files if you change this in config.php
- cd tables, run ./create_tables to create the database tables
- Try to open up localhost/appdb, if you get a directory listing
  Edit your /etc/apache/httpd.conf "DirectoryIndex" to include index.php 
  so apache will open index.php after not finding index.html/index.htm etc
- Check your /etc/php/php.ini to ensure that 'register_globals = On' as the 
  appdb uses globals and won't work correctly without this
