WineHQ Application Database TODO List

# incorporate templates into appdb to simplify code, Jeremy says we can 
borrow from lostwages(winehq.org/cvsweb/lostwages) for this

# make email address the users username

# check for existing email when user is creating a new account

# setup a cron job in a new /bin directory, put a deny all .htaccess 
file in there and purge all inactive accounts after 6 months of inactivity
RELATED TODO: how to handle deleting accounts that have comments?  go through 
and assign them to a special account number that prints (account deleted due 
to inactivity)

# screenshot submission isn't very friendly.  it would be really cool if 
people could submit screenshots via a web interface.  We would store the 
image and related information in the database and send email to the database 
admins and to any maintainers of the app.  They would then be able to click 
on a link in the email to view the image and accept/reject it.  If the image 
sat for too long it would be rejected and an email would be send to the 
submitter saying it timed out.  If the admin/maintainer clicked on accept it 
would go into the db like every other image.

# when deleting an application we should delete linked entries (screenshots, comments, etc.)

# when deleting a screenshot we should delete the image file as well

# appdb engine - clean up the php backend (see CODING_STANDARD for code style guidelines).
In particular globally registered vars should be replaced by superglobals (nearly finished)

# Super Maintainers should be able to edit the main app and send a notify message like the versions have.

# Add Maintainer rating system to the app version (Tony's working on it).

# revamp the star rating system (Chris)

# once maintainer rating system is in place revamp the front page to use a dynamic list of maintainer rated apps.

# add a system that well allow users to monitor an app without becoming a maintainer.

# add distro table and administration screens for it. (Chris)

# We need an administration screen for vendors.

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the user_list table.

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the appComments table.

# add new table for maintainer ratings. fields: userid, appId versionId ,rating, wineversion, distro, source/package
