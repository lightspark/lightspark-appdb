WineHQ Application Database TODO List

# screenshot submission isn't very friendly.  it would be really cool if 
people could submit screenshots via a web interface.  We would store the 
image and related information in the database and send email to the database 
admins and to any maintainers of the app.  They would then be able to click 
on a link in the email to view the image and accept/reject it.  If the image 
sat for too long it would be rejected and an email would be send to the 
submitter saying it timed out.  If the admin/maintainer clicked on accept it 
would go into the db like every other image.

# appdb engine - clean up the php backend (see CODING_STANDARD for code style guidelines). In particular globally registered vars should be replaced by superglobals and <? ?> should be replaced by <?php ?>.

# when we delete a comment there should be a box to explain why you are deleting this comment and an email should be sent to the submitter 

# Super Maintainers should be able to edit the main app and send a notify message like the versions have.

# Add Maintainer rating system to the app verision (tony's working on it).

# revamp the star rating system

# once maintainer rating system is in place revamp the front page to use a dynamic list of maintainer rated apps.

# add a system that well allow users to monitor an app without becoming a maintainer.
