WineHQ Application Database TODO List

# incorporate templates into appdb to simplify code, Jeremy says we can 
borrow from lostwages(winehq.org/cvsweb/lostwages) for this

# make email address the users username

# check for existing email when user is creating a new account

# setup a cron job in a new /bin directory, put a deny all .htaccess 
file in there and purge all inactive accounts after 6 months of inactivity
RELATED TODO: how to handle deleting accounts that have comments?  go through 
and assign them to a special account number that prints (account deleted due 
to inactivity)

# replace all mysql_query() by query_appdb() (available from include/db.php).
When it's done we have to remove opendb() function call in incl.php and definition 
in util.php as query_appdb already does the connection when needed.

# we have to check if we really need to separate user database from appdb database
(as seen in the config file and include/db.php)

# when deleting an application we should delete linked entries (screenshots, comments, etc.)

# when deleting a screenshot we should delete the image file as well

# appdb engine - clean up the php backend (see CODING_STANDARD for code style guidelines).
In particular globally registered vars should be replaced by superglobals (nearly finished)

# Super Maintainers should be able to edit the main app and send a notify message like the versions have.

# Add Maintainer rating system to the app version (Tony's working on it).

# revamp the star rating system (Chris)

# add a system that well allow users to monitor an app without becoming a maintainer.

# add distro table and administration screens for it. (Chris)

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the user_list table.

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the appComments table.

# add new table for maintainer ratings. fields: userid, appId versionId ,rating, wineversion, distro, source/package

# add user management
